# first-project
## A multicolour led cube ran by an arduino nano 

This is my first project that is i am designing and building by myself. It took a long time to think of what i am going to make, at first i was think of building an eread for my comic book but i quikly realized that it was out of my skill set. So after some long thinking a came across the led cud on youtube and thought to myself that it was an easy enough project for me do. After long search i found it great for a uniqe first project.

## Components 
* 3 - TLC5940 (LED driver) for each colour
* Arduino nano (microcontroller)
* 64 LEDs (4x4x4)
* 4 - IRF9540N
* 3 - 2k resistor
* 4 - 1k resistor
* 1 - 100nF capacitor
* 1 - 100uf capacitor
* 1 - power button
* 1 - 4 slots AA battery case
